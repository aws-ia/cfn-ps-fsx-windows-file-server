## Amazon FSx for Windows File Server

This Quick Start implements Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 1.5 hours. This Quick Start is for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, and DevOps professionals who are planning to implement Microsoft Windows file systems on AWS.

FSx for Windows File Server provides a fully managed native Microsoft Windows file system so that you can move your Windows-based applications that require shared file storage to AWS. The deployment includes your choice of AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD) or self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.

FSx for Windows File Server is not available in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see [Service Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html) in the AWS documentation.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy FSx for Windows File Server in your AWS account in about 1.5 hours.
